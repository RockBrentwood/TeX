These are some of the core files used for TeX, rewritten in straight-line pseudo code in a C-like language.
They are meant for display and reference only, though they will be used as the core of a rewrite.
The section/subsection numbering reflect the hierarchy in the *.web and *.w files; but do not normally display as such when the files are self-compiled into *.{tex,dvi,pdf}.

These are what the web files would look like if they were rewritten in c + Comments, with the hyperlinks removed.

The relation of the reworked files to the originals are:
WEB:
	tangle.web → TangleC.txt → Tangle.c
	weave.web → WeaveC.txt → Weave.c
C-WEB:
	ctangle.w → CTangleC.txt → CTangle.c
	cweave.w → CWeaveC.txt → CWeave.c
	common.w → Common{C,H}.txt → Common.c

The programs are rendered in more mathematical form (using UTF-8 UNICODE), as they are in the displays of the *.w and *.web files.
The operators
	↑, ↓, ≡, ≠, ≤, ≥, ∧, ∨, ←, →, ⊃, ⊂
correspond, respectively, to the C operators:
	++, --, ==, !=, <=, >=, &&, ||, =, ->, >>, <<
and respectively to the Pascal operators in all but the last 3 cases:
	inc(⋯), dec(⋯), =, <>, <=, >=, and, or, :=
